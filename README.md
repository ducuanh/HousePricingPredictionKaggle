# House Price Prediction in Poland

This project predicts house prices in Poland using machine learning, implemented in a Jupyter Notebook: **`HousePredictionPoland.ipynb`**.

##  Project Overview

The goal of this project is to estimate Polish real-estate prices based on features such as:

- Location / city
- Property size (m²)
- Number of rooms
- Floor level
- Year of construction / building age
- Additional property features (elevator, balcony, etc.)

The notebook includes full data preparation, model training, evaluation, and testing.
